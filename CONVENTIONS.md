# Python code conventions #

- Assume most recent Python

- Try to minimize number of external dependencies in production code (test dependencies are fine)

- Make the code unit testable where applicable

- Write pytest unit tests

- If updating code, update also e.g. corresponding READIME

- Keep comments up to brief, and use them only when necessary
